                        and the next generations, we have to rethink and
                        radically change the ways we consume
                        everything. Especially women as main consumers
                        have to take responsibility with their choices
                        when shopping and also have the healing female
                        power to spread awareness throughout the
                        world.
                        Our mission at Gaia Centre is to represent all
                        the sustainable brands and services for you in
                        one place whether you need groceries, make up,
                        clothing or you would want to treat yourself with
                        a meditation or yoga class.
                        Healed people can heal the World and each
                        other. We are in this together.
                        Come join us and let's make humanity a better
                        race than ever.</p>
